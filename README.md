  ### 2. Deploying
  - Install the Netlify CLI globally `npm install netlify-cli -g`
    
  - Run `npm run build`

  - Then use the `netlify deploy` for a deploy preview link or `netlify deploy --prod` to deploy to production

  Here are a few other ways you can deploy this template:
    
  - Use the Netlify CLI's create from template command `netlify sites:create-template astro-quickstart` which will create a repo, Netlify project, and deploy it
    
  - If you want to utilize continuous deployment through GitHub webhooks, run the Netlify command `netlify init` to create a new project based on your repo or `netlify link` to connect your repo to an existing project

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
